### Overview

Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a popular cloud storage service offered by Amazon Web Services (AWS). S3 provides a simple and scalable way to store and retrieve data from the cloud. 

If you are a cloud data engineering professional working on AWS Cloud there could have been various instances where one might needs to check the contents of the files either to 

In this post, we will explore the different options available to check the contents of a file stored in S3

##### Downloading the files to local system
: ABCDEFGH

* Any programming knowledge   
: Even though you can write SQL queries to perform data transformation, this is not the approach followed mostly in the industry. Familiarity with a programming language such as Scala, Python, Java, or R will give you an edge. If you don't have any programming background, I would recommend learning python 

* Spark Environment
: You need a spark cluster to perform spark operations. There are various options to accomplish this such as  
  * Installing spark on your local machine 
  * Using any managed services from a cloud provider ( eg: Amazon EMR)
  * Try Databricks community edition
    and so on ...

  I would recommend using Databricks Community Edition which is free of charge and you will get all the additional benefits of using the cloud and databricks unified platform.

#### Do handson
Perform the exercises discussed in the video sessions in your spark environment

#### Books
Every spark developer should have any of the below books. You will love reading the books if you are doing it post watching the videos.
* Spark â€“ The Definitive Guide: Big data processing made simple
* Learning Spark - Lightning-fast Data Analytics

#### More Handson...
Try out all the code samples given in the books

#### Familiarize yourself with Spark Documentation
When you use a specific spark transformation/action, try to understand more details of the same by using the 
[Spark documentation](https://spark.apache.org/documentation.html "Spark Documentation").

And that's a wrap, yo! You survived the first waves of learning Apache Spark...
<br/>More to follow and Good luck!!
