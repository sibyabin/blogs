If you are scoring less than 90% in the practise exam , you may need to prepare more.

#### 5. Writing the certification

* Certification exam link will be available 15 minutes before the scheduled time.
* Status of the exam will be displayed on the screen as soon as you complete the exam. However it will take few days to get the official result from databricks via email

#### Important points to remember

Rescheduling certification
: At the time of writing this blog , You can reschedule the certification with greater than twenty four (24) hours notice. It is chargeable otherwise.

Usage of test aid(Spark documentation)
: **This is VERY IMPORTANT !!** Test aid will be visible in the right pane of the exam window and there is no CTRL + F available for searching. If you are not sure which section of the test aid contains certain information , you will end up scrolling a lot during the exam which will consume lot of time and you wont be able to complete the exam in 2 hours time. The exam UI is not that user friendly as well.

Challenges in completing biometric 
: It is always stressful when you face last minute technical challenges. I had challenges in completing the biometric step from my device and had to spent many hours with the support team over chat to get that step done. Be ready to face these kind of setbacks on the day of the exam. However the support folks are helpful and will be able to guide you even if this happens ..
